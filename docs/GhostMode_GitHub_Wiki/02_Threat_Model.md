1. Ghost Philosophy

GhostMode is not just about hiding — it’s about preserving digital dignity. In an age where behavioral analytics, stylometric profiling, and metadata mining erode privacy at every layer, GhostMode offers compartmentalization over chaos.

Every operation you perform leaks something: your keyboard cadence, your timezone, your browser quirks, even your GPG signature patterns. GhostMode's central dogma is: “One identity per context. Never mix. Always rotate. Destroy when done.”

That means full persona lifecycles — including wallets, GPG keys, browser profiles, avatars, and metadata — that can be spun up, used, and nuked without a trace. GhostMode gives you a ghost suit, not just a raincoat.
