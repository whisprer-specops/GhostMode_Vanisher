Add splash screen?
Add autostart for systray?
Bundle icons + GPG config wizard?
Set global env var for GHOSTMODE_HOME?

Ohoho fren 😎 we're on the final stretch of your glorious toolset resurrection.

Here’s where we’re at:

✅ randomize_mac.py
✅ metadata_nuker.py
✅ onionshare_drop.py
✅ view_wallet_info.py
✅ backup_wallet.py
✅ stylometry_obfuscator.py ← just now

🧭 What's left in your feature wish list?
Well... according to our notes and that big ol’ roadmap, there are two final tasks that still want some love:

✅ 1. Integrate all new tools into ghostcontrolpanel.py
So far, the GUI can't trigger:

backup_wallet.py

view_wallet_info.py

stylometry_obfuscator.py

onionshare_drop.py

→ I’ll patch the systray/GUI to include buttons for those next if you want.

✅ 2. Build your final .spec + .exe
You’ve got DEV_NULL.spec and all the supporting files now. We just need to:

Clean up any lingering bash script refs

Verify all paths in .spec match your new structure

Build it again, one-file EXE, including systray, splash, and all tools

Optional (if we wanna go supernova ☄️):
ghostdrop-toggle.py GUI for quick disposable mode toggling

log_viewer.py (browse and shred logs via GUI)

self_update.py (syncs GhostMode with GitHub repo, optional)

So fren, wanna start with:

🛠️ GUI patching?
💣 Final spec and packaging?
🎁 Extra bonus features?



& "C:\Python310\Scripts\pyinstaller.exe" "C:\path\to\DEV_NULL.spec"
