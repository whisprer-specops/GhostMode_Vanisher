Welcome, fren. You‚Äôre staring into the black mirror of GhostMode‚Ñ¢ ‚Äì a full-spectrum, operational anonymity toolkit built for journalists, cypherpunks, dissidents, and hardcore privacy maximalists. This isn‚Äôt just ‚Äúyet another wallet wrapper.‚Äù Oh no. This is a digital ghostshell for your entire crypto life, featuring:

- Cold + Hot Monero transaction pipelines
- GPG + Stego + Fernet-based unlock flows
- Browser fingerprint randomization
- Identity rotation systems (wallet, GPG, browser, metadata)
- PyQt5 GUI frontends and full CLI fallback
- Self-installing .deb and AppImage packages
- Server-authenticated unlock & packaging DRM with tamper-detection
- GhostDrop‚Ñ¢ auto-wipe system
- Audit logging (local + remote)
- Stylometry anonymization
- Optional bonus: Card Fraud Simulator 9000‚Ñ¢

This README_TOTAL.md is your 20-page gospel to the invisible cathedral of GhostMode. It includes everything: what, why, how, and a few winks along the way.

## 1. Ghost Philosophy

GhostMode is not just about hiding ‚Äî it‚Äôs about preserving digital dignity. In an age where behavioral analytics, stylometric profiling, and metadata mining erode privacy at every layer, GhostMode offers compartmentalization over chaos.

Every operation you perform leaks something: your keyboard cadence, your timezone, your browser quirks, even your GPG signature patterns. GhostMode's central dogma is: ‚ÄúOne identity per context. Never mix. Always rotate. Destroy when done.‚Äù

That means full persona lifecycles ‚Äî including wallets, GPG keys, browser profiles, avatars, and metadata ‚Äî that can be spun up, used, and nuked without a trace. GhostMode gives you a ghost suit, not just a raincoat.
"""

section_2_threat_model = """
## 2. Threat Model

GhostMode is hardened against the following:

- Passive network surveillance (metadata/time correlation)
- Active fingerprinting (browser entropy, MACs, TLS signatures)
- Stylometry (authorship detection)
- Forensic USB traces and swap residue
- Identity crossover via logs or config bleed
- Crypto wallet leakages (e.g. Monero .keys or view-only wallets)

It does **not** protect against:

- UEFI/BIOS level malware
- Physical access keylogging
- Pre-compromised systems
- NSO-tier adversaries with upstream control

GhostMode was built to disappear from the eyes of everyone *except maybe God and Google Cloud's SIEM.*
"""

section_3_architecture = """
## 3. Core Architecture

GhostMode is structured as a modular privacy and transaction stack:


```
                     +-----------------------------+
                     |     PyQt5 GUI Frontend      |
                     +-----------------------------+
                     |     CLI Utilities & Tools   |
                     +-----------------------------+
                     |   Identity Rotation Engine  |
                     |  (browser + wallet + GPG)   |
+-------------+      +-----------------------------+      +---------------------+
| Cold Wallet | <--> |    GPG TX Encrypt + USB     | <--> | Hot Wallet RPC/CLI  |
+-------------+      +-----------------------------+      +---------------------+
                     |    Remote Unlock Server     |
                     +-----------------------------+
                     | Secure Packaging / DRM Unit |
                     +-----------------------------+
                     | Steganographic Key Delivery |
                     +-----------------------------+
```

It supports:

- Offline `.txn` creation and cold signing
- USB airgap copy with encrypted payload
- GUI decrypt and broadcast
- Identity-based routing (per profile)
- Unlocker tools with brute-force limits
- Full-pack bundling and DRM
- Tamper-proof logging and wipe triggers

Each tool can function standalone or as part of the full GhostMode stack. The system is highly composable.

18. FAQ
Q: Can I use this on Windows?
A: Not recommended. Designed for Linux and security-hardened distros (Tails, Whonix, Qubes).

Q: Does this protect against NSA?
A: No. But it makes metadata collection extremely painful.

Q: Can I use my own wallet or GPG key?
A: Yep. Import via identikit.sh or drop into ~/.ghost_identities.
