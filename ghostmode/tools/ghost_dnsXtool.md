Boom, here it is ‚Äî your slick, one-stop DNS control panel in CLI form:
üéõÔ∏è Download ghost_dnsmode.sh

Usage:
./ghost_dnsmode.sh --fix     # Lock in static Cloudflare DNS for WSL
./ghost_dnsmode.sh --reset   # Revert to default WSL DNS behavior

No fuss, no reruns ‚Äî just toggle your ghost mode like a proper ops wizard.

In other words, you dumb enough to _Still be using win even after we said USE LINUX?
you now having the classic WSL DNS nightmares?
then just run this lil magic bestie and all your troubles will be solved!

Furthermore, having a panoic cos win no longer works right when you try to go back to normal win?
then jusdt run the reset to revert back - now dad will  never know you nearly bronkened the intewebs for good! :D  Yaaaay!
