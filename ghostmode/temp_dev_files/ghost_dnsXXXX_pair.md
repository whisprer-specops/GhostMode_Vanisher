hereâ€™s a trusty DNS ghostbuster:

for those of you plagued by DNs troubles like the classic WSL nightmares presentin inwindows ( D:  told you - USE LINUX!!!)

ðŸ“œ run ghost_dnsfixX.sh

This script:
Permanently disables WSLâ€™s overwriting of /etc/resolv.conf
Writes a static DNS (Cloudflare 1.1.1.1)
Locks it down with chattr
Verifies DNS live via ping downloads.getmonero.org

Just run it when DNS fails, and youâ€™re instantly ghosted back online. :D

---
Need a reverse/unlock for whatever reason? \

Areverse/unlock/reset script is presen t too, after all, it is wise to always be able to undo whatever messin about one has done - _always_ prudent to be able to retrace steps/return things to whence they came eh (especially if you gotta use your windows as windows after lolololol!)

welp, just
ðŸ“œ run  ghost_dnsresX.sh

and ya back where ya started all like nothing was ever messed with - now dad wont find out and you got away with it before the computer was 'bronken'... :D
